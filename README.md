# Self-Checkout-System

### This project is the NEA Project I made for my A level Computer Science Coursework. 
### It uses a python Library called Appjar that allows you to create a user interface. 
### It is a self checkout system has a login feature, create account feature, a sign in as guest feature, a main menu, a review order page and a final order page.
### Each page of the progect has its own function in which i used python to code what each page does.

### To Access this project you must make sure that once you create your own repository you make sure that you keep all the files within the Appjar file to make sure it can access the relevant appjar files.
